## 2. Test Design

### 2.1 Load Profile

200 Virtual Users (VUs) simulating concurrent students in a staged ramp pattern:

| Stage | Duration | VUs | Purpose |
|-------|----------|-----|---------|
| Ramp-up | 1 min | 0 → 50 | Gradual load introduction |
| Ramp to peak | 2 min | 50 → 200 | Stress escalation |
| Sustain peak | 2 min | 200 | Maximum concurrent load |
| Ramp-down | 1 min | 200 → 0 | Graceful release |

### 2.2 Simulated User Workflow

Each VU executes a **complete student lecture-viewing session**:

1. Health check → Verify system availability  
2. Join live stream → `POST /api/stream/join/:lectureId` (JWT authenticated)  
3. Poll stream status → `GET /api/stream/hls-status/:lectureId` (periodic)  
4. Browse catalog → `GET /api/lectures` (30% of users)  
5. HLS segment playback → Manifest + `.ts` chunk downloads (HLS tier viewers)  

Realistic behaviors: **20% early departure**, **10% mid-stream seek**, **10% quality switch**

### 2.3 NFR Thresholds

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| HTTP response p95 | < 500ms | Acceptable API responsiveness |
| HTTP failure rate | < 10% | System stability under load |
| Join latency p95 | < 1,000ms | Seamless user join experience |
| Segment download p95 | < 2,000ms | Prevents video buffering |

## 4. Comparison: Before vs After Scaling

| Metric | 1× Engine | 3× Engine | Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| HTTP Failure Rate | 0.00% | 0.00% | — |
| HTTP p95 Latency | 430.59ms | 434.37ms | +0.9% |
| Median Latency | 3.39ms | 2.10ms | -38% ↓ |
| Max Latency | 2.75s | 2.46s | -10.5% ↓ |
| Join Latency avg | 456.75ms | 488.84ms | — |
| Join Latency p95 | 1.43s | 1.46s | — |
| Throughput | 33.1 req/s | 32.9 req/s | — |
| Checks Passed | 100% | 100% | — |

**Note on local Docker scaling:** Both runs were executed on the **same laptop** sharing the same CPU and memory. Scaling from 1→3 streaming-engine instances in this environment distributes work across more containers but does **not** add physical compute resources — all containers compete for the same hardware. The results confirm the system is architecturally sound: Nginx correctly load-balances across all 3 instances via `least_conn`, and the system maintains **zero errors** with **100% check pass rate** even with the increased container overhead. The true benefit of horizontal scaling would be observed when each instance runs on **dedicated cloud infrastructure** with independent CPU, memory, and network.

---

## 5. Key NFR Achievements

### ✅ Zero Downtime Under Load
The system handled **200 concurrent users** across **13,000+ requests** with a **0% failure rate** in both configurations. No HTTP errors, no connection resets, no timeouts on standard API endpoints.

### ✅ Sub-500ms API Response Time
General API responsiveness (p95 = ~430ms) stayed well within the 500ms threshold throughout both test runs, even during peak sustained load at 200 VUs.

### ✅ Stable Throughput
Consistent ~33 req/s throughput maintained across the full 6-minute test duration with no degradation during peak load or ramp-down phases.

### ✅ 100% Functional Correctness
All 14,900+ assertion checks passed — every join returned a valid viewer tier, every health check responded, every catalog query returned data.

### ✅ Fault Isolation Validated
The microservice architecture demonstrated clean separation: streaming-engine handles join/session logic independently from core-api (catalog, auth), and both operate without interference under concurrent load.

### ⚠️ Join Latency at Scale
The stream join operation (`POST /api/stream/join/:lectureId`) exceeded the 1s p95 target at 200 concurrent users. This endpoint involves a database query + an external LiveKit API call, which introduces I/O-bound latency under high concurrency. The median join latency remains healthy at ~295ms — the p95 tail is driven by request queuing at peak load.

## 6. Container Resource Usage (During Peak Load)

| Container | CPU | Memory | Network I/O |
|-----------|-----|--------|-------------|
| core-api | ~0% | 62.52 MiB | 552 kB / 523 kB |
| streaming-engine (×3) | ~0% each | ~29 MiB each | ~140 kB / ~79 kB |
| api-gateway (Nginx) | ~0% | 7.89 MiB | 546 kB / 643 kB |
| PostgreSQL | ~0% | 20.09 MiB | 183 kB / 193 kB |
| Redis | ~0.95% | 3.91 MiB | 79.5 kB / 65 kB |
| MinIO | ~0.11% | 48.42 MiB | 34.2 kB / 10.1 kB |

**All containers operated well within resource limits.** No container exceeded 1% CPU or approached memory limits, indicating significant headroom available when deployed on dedicated hardware.

---

## 7. Theoretical Performance Projections

The projections below estimate system behavior when deployed on **real cloud infrastructure** (e.g., AWS EC2 / GCP Compute Engine) where each scaled instance has **dedicated CPU, memory, and network bandwidth**.

### 7.1 At 500 Concurrent Users

**Projected Configuration:** 3× core-api, 3× streaming-engine, 1× Nginx, 1× PostgreSQL (4 vCPU), 1× Redis, 1× MinIO

| Metric | Projected Value | Rationale |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| HTTP Failure Rate | < 1% | Demonstrated 0% at 200; headroom from dedicated CPU |
| HTTP p95 Latency | ~300–500ms | Load-balanced across 3 instances with dedicated cores |
| Join Latency p95 | ~600–900ms | DB connection pooling + dedicated DB CPU reduces query time |
| Join Latency median | ~200–300ms | Consistent with observed median at lower load |
| Throughput | ~80–100 req/s | Linear scaling from 33 req/s × 3 instances with dedicated resources |
| Segment Download p95 | < 500ms | CDN/MinIO on dedicated storage handles concurrent reads |

**Expected NFR Status:**

| NFR | Status |
|-----|--------|
| HTTP p95 < 500ms | ✅ Achievable |
| Failure rate < 10% | ✅ Achievable |
| Join latency p95 < 1s | ✅ Likely achievable with dedicated DB resources |
| Segment download p95 < 2s | ✅ Achievable |

### 7.2 At 1,000 Concurrent Users

**Projected Configuration:** 5× core-api, 5× streaming-engine, 2× Nginx, 1× PostgreSQL (8 vCPU, read replica), 1× Redis cluster, MinIO behind CDN

| Metric | Projected Value | Rationale |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| HTTP Failure Rate | < 2% | Horizontal scaling distributes load; Redis caching reduces DB pressure |
| HTTP p95 Latency | ~400–700ms | More instances but higher contention on shared state |
| Join Latency p95 | ~500–1,200ms | DB read replica offloads SELECT queries; LiveKit call is the limiting factor |
| Join Latency median | ~250–400ms | Distributed load keeps median healthy |
| Throughput | ~150–200 req/s | Near-linear scaling with 5 instances on dedicated hardware |
| Segment Download p95 | < 1,000ms | CDN caching eliminates MinIO as a bottleneck |

**Expected NFR Status:**

| NFR | Status |
|-----|--------|
| HTTP p95 < 500ms | ⚠️ May need tuning at sustained peak |
| Failure rate < 10% | ✅ Achievable |
| Join latency p95 < 1s | ⚠️ Borderline — depends on DB and LiveKit capacity |
| Segment download p95 < 2s | ✅ Achievable with CDN |
